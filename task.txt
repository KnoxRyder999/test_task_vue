As a freelancer, I am going to apply a job.
Following is the test task for the job.

Test task

You are going through the testing stage for the project of our product fintech team. We have several directions, we work only with professionals. How you complete this task - such a result you show, such a result we will expect from you on real tasks.

Recommendation: do everything clearly, do not ignore details. Any deviation from the requirements is an automatic refusal.

Part 1. Mini-SPA

Single-page application on Vue 3 + TypeScript + Firebase Functions
Email field
“Remember my email” button
Email is saved in Firestore via Cloud Function (function name — the name of your favorite dish; explain the choice of collection in one sentence in the code)
Email is displayed on the page
On reboot — email is loaded from Firestore
Implement one function only via Promise then/catch (without async/await)
Put all interface texts in a separate file (for example, messages.ts)
In the code — a one-line comment with an interesting fact about yourself or your favorite city
README: explanation of the collection name + instructions for launching

Violation of even one point leads to failure of the entire test task

Part 2. Using AI
Suggest one feature for the application that can be implemented using AI (for example: smart email validation, auto-generation of translations, hints, etc.) etc.)
Use any AI tool (ChatGPT, Copilot, Perplexity, Claude, etc.) — describe the result or paste the generated code/dialogue into README.
Briefly describe how you integrated or would integrate it.

Submission format:
GitHub repository or archive
README with instructions
Record the entire screen with sound — your voice comments while completing this test task

Only those who can do exactly what is written and do it quickly will go further.
